# Time-Series-Forecasting

Time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. The data is organized by relatively deterministic timestamps, and may, compared to random sample data, contain additional information that we can extract.

Time series observation can be decomposed into:
- Trend
- Seasonality
- Residuals

Forecasting of time series requires us to pay attention to:
- Stationarity
- Train/test data splitting
- Cross and walk-forward validation
